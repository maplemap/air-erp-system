# DjangoAir ERP System Analysis and Decomposition

## Project Overview

DjangoAir is an ERP system designed to unify multiple services, primarily a booking and check-in service, within one comprehensive platform. The application supports independent web interfaces for customers and staff, each tailored to meet specific user needs and workflows. It aims to streamline ticket booking, boarding, and check-in processes with the flexibility for role-based staff access, social login, and payment integrations.

## Development Plan

### Priority Steps

1. **Core Model and Database Setup**
   - **Goal**: Establish the foundational entities and relationships in PostgreSQL.
   - **Steps**:
     - Define essential entities: `Flight`, `Passenger`, `Ticket`, `SeatType`, `Option`, and `Discount`.
     - Establish relationships between these entities.
     - Migrate models and ensure integrity of the data structure.

2. **Customer Booking Interface**
   - **Goal**: Build the user-facing interface for booking flights.
   - **Steps**:
     - Implement the initial screen for customers to select destination, date, and passenger count.
     - Add a screen to display available seats, pricing, and additional options like meals and luggage.
     - Create a final booking screen with payment information, confirmation, and email receipt.

3. **Staff Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - **Goal**: Ensure secure access based on staff roles.
   - **Steps**:
     - Implement roles for `Gate Manager`, `Check-in Manager`, and `Supervisor` with Djangoâ€™s permissions system.
     - Develop workflows for each role, granting access to relevant actions (e.g., gate access, check-in, and flight management).
     - Set up access restrictions and testing to verify correct role behaviors.

4. **Notifications System**
   - **Goal**: Provide timely notifications for bookings and updates.
   - **Steps**:
     - Configure email and webhook notifications to inform customers about booking confirmations and updates.
     - Use Celery for asynchronous task management to ensure notifications are sent without blocking main application threads.
     - Test notifications across scenarios to confirm reliable delivery.

5. **Optional Integrations**
   - **Goal**: Enhance the booking system with social login, payment, and API support.
   - **Steps**:
     - **Social Login**: Integrate a social login provider (e.g., Google or Facebook) for enhanced customer convenience.
     - **Payment Integration**: Implement a third-party payment emulator to provide a realistic booking experience.
     - **API for Mobile and Third-Party Services**: Use Flask to build a REST API for mobile applications and webhooks for third-party integrations.

### Secondary Steps
